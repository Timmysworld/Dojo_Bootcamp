There are a few things to double check each time you create a .java file.

1. File and class names must match.
    The file name and class name need to be exactly the same, or it wonâ€™t compile. 
    In this case, Test.java and class Test

2. File and class names should be Pascal case.
    The file name and class name should be written Pascal case. 
    It should start with an uppercase letter and start each word with another capital letter. 
    For example, a class file with all the methods (functions) for a bank account would be called BankAccount.java and class BankAccount

3. Every time you make a change to your code, you will need to re-compile it.
